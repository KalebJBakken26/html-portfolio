<h1>The Best Movies/Shows According to Kaleb</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Naruto, Naruto: Shippuden</h3>
<p>Now I have both the first series and second series as together, just because I enjoyed both. I connected with alot of the characters in these series, I cried, I laughed and I grieved with these characters. One of my all time animes for sure!

<h3>Assassin's Creed 2016 20th Century Fox Film </h3>
<p>Now I have been an immense fan of this genre so to speak, whether it has been the books, or games, and now movie. To me Micheal Fassbender played such a good role and did excellent and I could not have asked for a better adaptation of the Assassin's Creed.</p>

<h3>The Witcher, Original Netlix Series </h3>
<p>Another adaptation that I absolutely enjoyed! I have the books, and have played the games and have been so fascinated by the world that Geralt of Rivia is in, and something even better is Henry Cavill who played as Geralt. He brought Geralt to life and I think what helped is that Henry is a die hard fan of the Witcher Geralt of Rivia (not as much as he is a fan of Warhammer 40K though) </p>
